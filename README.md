# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** 🚀
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights.

It’s designed as a **portfolio project** to showcase my skills in **Data Engineering, SQL Development, ETL Pipelines, and Analytics** using industry best practices.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

I followed the **Medallion Architecture** approach with **Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**:

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**

   * Stores raw data directly from source systems.
   * Data ingested from CSV files into **SQL Server**.

2. **Silver Layer**

   * Handles data cleaning, deduplication, standardization, and normalization.
   * Prepares data for downstream analytical workloads.

3. **Gold Layer**

   * Business-ready data modeled in a **Star Schema**.
   * Optimized for reporting, dashboards, and advanced analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Data Engineering – Building the Warehouse

* Consolidate ERP & CRM datasets into SQL Server.
* Ensure **data quality** with cleansing and transformations.
* Integrate into a unified **star schema** for analysis.

### Data Analysis – Reporting & Insights

Developed SQL reports and dashboards with insights into:

* **Customer Behavior** (acquisition, retention, segmentation)
* **Product Performance** (top-selling products, underperformers)
* **Sales Trends** (monthly, quarterly, yearly KPIs)



## 📋 Project Overview

This repository consists of two major components:

1. **Data Engineering / ETL & Warehouse**

   * CSV ingestion, transformations, and modeling
   * Building dimension/fact tables suited for analytics

2. **Analytics / SQL Reporting & Exploration**

   * Structured SQL scripts to explore, analyze, and report on the warehouse
   * Insights into customers, products, sales, and trends

This makes the project truly **end-to-end**, covering both backend data engineering and frontend analytics.

🎯 This project highlights my skills in:

* SQL Development
* Data Modeling
* ETL & Data Pipelines
* Data Warehousing
* Analytics & Reporting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **SQL Server Express / Full** — Data warehouse engine
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** — SQL execution, query workbench
* **CSV / flat files** — Source data (ERP, CRM)
* **DrawIO** — Architecture, flow, and model diagrams
* **Git / GitHub** — Version control and collaboration

## 📈 Analytics & Insights Overview

Using the `data_analysis_scripts/` scripts, here are some of the business insights you’ll find:

* **Customer Behavior**

  * Top customers by total spend
  * Churn/retention analyses
  * Segmentation by purchase frequency, recency, and value

* **Product Performance**

  * Best-selling and underperforming products
  * Category-level contribution to revenue

* **Sales Trends & Growth**

  * Monthly / annual trend analyses
  * Period-over-period growth comparisons
  * Cumulative growth & lifetime metrics

* **Detailed Reports**

  * Customer-level summary tables
  * Product-level rating and performance dashboards

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

* Demonstrates an **end-to-end pipeline**: from raw ingestion to business insights
* Separation of concerns: ingestion (bronze), transformation (silver), analytics (gold + reporting)
* Modular & reusable SQL scripts for analytics + reporting
* Easily extensible: add more dimensions, metrics, or analytics scripts
* Clear documentation and visual diagrams to support understanding
